        <!--HTML Elements:
        INLINE: can co-exist on the same line as other elements eg. <em></em>
        BLOCK: exclusively takes up an entire block made of several line(s) and has a line break before or afterwards eg. <p></p>)
        INLINE BLOCK: a hybrid of both inline and block. It's mostly <image>.
        
        NOTE: You can use CSS to make any element inline block.-->
        
        <!-- You can use <br> to put a line break after an element i.e. break blocks into lines. Do remember that <br> is self-closing.-->
