<!--As you know, HTML fundamentally adds meaning to a webpage. Meaning is simply what the webpage's content means i.e. the semantic value, the tags, the structure of how you write your documents-->

<!--As can be seen in the above code, the <h1></h1>, <p></p>, <article></article>, <header></header>, <footer></footer> tags bring meaning to the content on a webpage. These tags tell the browser what you're looking for or looking to see. It makes the content you see make sense.-->
        
        <span></span>
        
        <div></div>
        
<!--On the flip side, there are tags in HTML known as <span></span> and <div></div>. They are also known as "meaningless" tags in the sense that they have no meaning whatsoever.

<!--Ironically, <span></span> and <div></div> are the most commonly used tags on any given website. This is because they do add value to your content in a way when you start adding IDs and Classes.-->
        
<!--You can use <span></span> and <div></div> to wrap content i.e. as a "container" of content. See illustration below-->
        
        <div id="header-content">
            <h2>Ace's Website</h2>

            <p>Welcome to my website. <span class="important">Please take your time</span> and <span class="important"> explore my portfolio</span></p>
    
            <ul>
                <li>Home</li>
                <li>Portfolio</li>
                <li>Contact</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
<!--Instead of styling each element or tag individually, <div></div> allows you to select the entire code section from <h2> through to </ul> for group styling-->
        
<!--Beyond text-wrapping, the above <div></div> still has no meaning. You can add meaning by adding an ID to the tag. This would allow you to select the defined ID in CSS and then style the entire contents of the div section or container if you like.-->
        
<!--The biggest difference between span and div is that span is an inline element (i.e. has no width, no breaking after the element it sits within) while div is a block-level element (takes the entire width and has a line break after the element.-->
        
<!--<span></span> similar to <em></em> and <strong></strong> can be used to style a specific element of text within your content (inline). It can be used with an ID or a Class if there are multiple <span></span> you want to style the same way-->
