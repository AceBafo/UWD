<!--IDs and Classes are attributes added to a tag. As you know, attributes give meaning or extra information about a specific tag.-->

<!--IDs and Classes work in a way that the ID is a unique identifier of an element and a Class as a global identifier of an element.-->

<!--You cannot have multiple instances of the same ID but you can have multiple instances of a Class. This is because IDs are unique identifiers. Think of it as your personal ID number on your Ghana Card or passport or drivers' license-->

<!--Unlike IDs, you can have multiple instances of a Class as seen in the code above. This is because Classes are global identifiers and you can use them multiple times throughout the webpage or website-->
        
<!--IDs & Classes are extremely useful in CSS because in CSS you can select an element and for instance, instead of selecting all paragraph tags and making them the colour red, you can select specific paragraph tags of a defined class and change their colour to red in one go.-->
        
<!--Think of IDs & Classes as components in Figma-->
